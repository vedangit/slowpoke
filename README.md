**Slowpoke** is a lightweight Python package that helps you monitor and log **slow API routes** in your Flask application. If you're wondering _"Which endpoints are dragging me down?"_, Slowpoke has your back.

---

## 🚀 Installation

Until we publish on PyPI, install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vedangit/slowpoke.git
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### 1. Add `slowpoke` to your Flask app

```python
from flask import Flask
from slowpoke import SlowpokeLogger

app = Flask(__name__)
slowpoke_logger = SlowpokeLogger(app, threshold_ms=1000)
```

> The `threshold_ms` parameter sets the time (in milliseconds) after which a request is considered slow.

---

### 2. Run your app normally

Make requests as usual. Slowpoke will track how long each endpoint takes.

---

### 3. View the report

Once you've made some requests, generate a report from the command line:

```bash
slowpoke report
```

This will print a table of all routes that exceeded the threshold, including method, endpoint, duration, and timestamp.

---

## 🧪 Example App

You can test out `slowpoke` quickly by running the example Flask app:

```bash
cd examples
python app.py
```

Then hit some routes and run:

```bash
slowpoke report
```
